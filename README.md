## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core (Networking & IaC)

- **Terraform ‚â• 1.5** ‚Äî Infrastructure as Code for multi-region VPCs, subnets, EC2, VPNs, and security groups  
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** ‚Äî  
  - **VPC & Subnets** (multi-AZ design for resiliency)  
  - **Site-to-Site VPN / Direct Connect** for hybrid connectivity  
  - **IAM & Roles** with least-privilege policies for EC2, VPN, and networking services  
  - **S3 + Glacier** for backups and cross-region replication  
- **gcloud / aws CLI** ‚Äî project context, credentials, and plan/apply automation  

### Diagrams

- **Mermaid** ‚Äî lightweight inline diagrams for GitHub/README  
- **Lucidchart** or **Diagrams (Python)** ‚Äî polished architecture diagrams (export PNG/SVG for README + slides)  

### CI/CD

- **AWS CodePipeline / CodeBuild** ‚Äî Terraform `fmt/validate/plan/apply` pipeline  
- **GitHub Actions (optional)** ‚Äî workflow automation for linting (`cfn-lint`, `terraform validate`)  

### Secrets & Config

- **AWS Secrets Manager** or environment variables for VPN PSKs, key pairs, and Terraform provider creds  

> Note: Application services (e.g., AppStream, WorkSpaces, ECS Fargate) will be layered in during Task 2/3. The current stack is **networking + infrastructure automation first**, followed by secure exam app modernization.

## üîó Branches

### [`Task 1 Branch`](https://github.com/tiqsclass6/gpc-armageddon/tree/task-1)

![task1-diagrams](/diagrams/task1-diagram.png)

**Task 1 ‚Äî Multi‚ÄëAccount VPN + Ring Topology (Terraform):**

- Build a **Classic or HA VPN** between **Balerica Inc. (GCP)** and your **team‚Äôs GCP account(s)**.
- Connect **specific subnets** from each team member to each other (ring or similar topology) **and** to Balerica Inc.
- Provide a **Terraform module/file per participant** for their connections (to Balerica and to peers) with clear comments.
- Include a **network topology diagram** that shows the inter‚Äëmember ring and connections to Balerica Inc.
- Add evidence: screenshots of VPN tunnels = `ESTABLISHED`, Cloud Router BGP sessions = `ESTABLISHED`, and learned routes to peer prefixes.

### What‚Äôs included in `task-1`

- Scope/requirements and links for Task 1, plus references to provider configuration and multi-account patterns.
- Use provider **aliases / multiple credentials** to target the hub and participant projects from a single workspace.
- Ensure unique, non-overlapping CIDRs per participant; set VPC `dynamic routing mode = GLOBAL` where cross-region propagation is required.

### [`Task 2 Branch`](https://github.com/tiqsclass6/gpc-armageddon/tree/task-2)

![task2-diagrams](/diagrams/task2-diagram.png)

**Task 2 ‚Äî Cloud Run with Traffic Splitting (Be a Man #10):**

> This task implements a Flask app deployed on **Google Cloud Run** with traffic split across **four revisions** at **40% / 40% / 10% / 10%**. It includes CI/CD via **Cloud Build** and a full set of screenshots and docs.

### What‚Äôs included in `task-2`

- **Cloud Run deployment** of a Flask web app using **Google Cloud Buildpacks**.
- **Traffic splitting across four revisions** (v1, v2, v3, v4) at **40/40/10/10** using revision tags.
- **Environment-based variants** (set in *Variables & Secrets* per revision):
  - **version1: ‚ÄúYou Are The One Neo‚Äù**
  - **version2: ‚ÄúFight Smith Until the End‚Äù**
  - **version3: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Give Up‚Äù**
  - **version4: ‚ÄúSmith Is Destroyed‚Äù**
- **CI/CD with Cloud Build**: repository-connected trigger that builds and deploys on commit.
- **Documentation & evidence**: screenshots of Cloud Build, service config, revision env vars, and traffic split.

### Repo layout (key files)

- `main.py` ‚Äî Flask entrypoint  
- `templates/index.html` ‚Äî UI template (Matrix background + dynamic text via env vars)  
- `.env` ‚Äî example environment values (**`do not commit secrets`**)
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äî Python deps  
- `Screenshots/` ‚Äî deployment evidence (e.g., `cloud-run-from-github.jpg`, `cloud-run-with-revisions.jpg`, `cloud-run-split-traffic-revisions.jpg`, `armageddon-app-v1..v4.jpg`, `diagram.png`)  
- `README.md` ‚Äî step-by-step guide, troubleshooting, and screenshot links

### [`Task 3 Branch`](https://github.com/tiqsclass6/gpc-armageddon/tree/task-3)

![task3-diagrams](/diagrams/task3-diagram.png)

**Task 3 ‚Äî Regional Scale‚ÄëOut VMs + Connectivity in Terraform (Be A Man 5):**

- Create a **Linux VM in a separate region for each group member**.
- Use a **firewall tag named after each member** for the member‚Äôs Linux VM.
- Ensure the **Windows VM can reach all Linux VMs**.
- Provide a **step‚Äëby‚Äëstep guide** in this README (to be added in the next commit under ‚ÄúTask 3 Guide‚Äù).  
- Provide a **Terraform file per participant** with comments.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This main branch serves as the landing page and coordination space. Detailed app code for Task 2 is on the branch below.

Here‚Äôs the exact **Solo Project** section I inserted into your README:

### [`Solo Project Branch`](https://github.com/tiqsclass6/gpc-armageddon-class-6.5/tree/solo-project)

#### *Network Diagram Will Go Here*

**Solo Project ‚Äî End-to-End GCP Deployment (Terraform + Cloud Build):**

- **Networking:** Dedicated VPC, subnets, firewall rules, and optional **HA VPN** connectivity to the class hub.
- **Compute:** Per-region **Compute Engine** instances for testing connectivity and latency.
- **App (optional):** Minimal container/service to validate egress, IAM, and logging paths.
- **CI/CD:** Cloud Build pipeline for `terraform fmt/validate/plan/apply`, with triggers on push.
- **State & Secrets:** Remote state (GCS) and Secret Manager for sensitive values (e.g., VPN PSKs).
- **Docs & Evidence:** README steps, diagrams, and screenshots to prove connectivity and provisioning.

#### Quick Start (Solo Project)

```bash
gcloud config set project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
```

```bash
terraform fmt
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

> Tip: Use distinct **CIDR ranges** from Tasks 1‚Äì3 to avoid overlaps; keep firewall tags consistent for end-to-end reachability.
