# Support Guidelines

Thank you for using **GPC Armageddon**! This document explains how to get help for **all tasks** in this repo:

- **Task 1:** Terraform networking (VPCs, Subnets, Cloud Router/BGP, HA/Classic VPN, NCC)
- **Task 2:** Application components (e.g., Cloud Run) and CI/CD
- **Task 3:** Additional infrastructure/networking extensions

> If your concern involves a **security vulnerability**, please follow **SECURITY.md** instead of opening a public issue.

## Where to Get Help

### üêû Report Bugs (GitHub Issues)

- Use the **Issues** tab: <https://github.com/tiqsclass6/gpc-armageddon/issues>
- Please include:
  - **Branch:** `task-1` / `task-2` / `task-3`
  - **Commit SHA** (if known)
  - **What happened vs. what you expected**
  - **Steps to reproduce** (exact commands, order, and flags)
  - **Relevant files/snippets** (redact secrets)
  - **Logs / screenshots** (e.g., `terraform plan/apply`, Cloud Router BGP status, VPN tunnel status)

### üí° Request Features

- Open an Issue with the **Feature Request** label.
- Describe the **use case**, **benefit**, and any **alternatives** you tried.

### üîí Security Issues

- **Do not** open a public issue.
- Follow **SECURITY.md** (private email/advisory + 72h ack / 14d target fix).

### üìß Contact Maintainers

- Email: `daquietstorm22@gmail.com`

---

## Before You File an Issue

- Search existing issues and discussions.
- Re-run with the latest commit on your branch.
- For Terraform:
  - `terraform fmt` / `terraform validate`
  - Confirm **Terraform ‚â• 1.5**
  - Check provider auth (`gcloud auth application-default login`), project/region
- For Cloud Run / Task 2:
  - Confirm service URL, IAM, and ingress settings
  - Check last build logs (Cloud Build / CI)

---

## Triage & Labels

We use labels to communicate status:

- `bug`, `feature`, `question`, `docs`
- `needs-repro`, `needs-info`, `blocked`, `duplicate`, `wontfix`
- `security` (redirects to SECURITY.md workflow)
- `good first issue`, `help wanted`

## Troubleshooting Quick Checks

### Task 1 / Task 3 (Terraform Networking)

- **BGP not Established?**
  - Ensure **Cloud Router** and **HA VPN** are in the **same region**.
  - Verify BGP peer IPs use link-local ranges (`169.254.0.0/16`) with proper mask (/30 or /31).
  - Check **PSKs** match on both sides.
- **No spoke‚Üîspoke routes?**
  - VPC peering is **non-transitive**. Use **HA VPN + Cloud Router (BGP)** through the hub or **NCC**.
  - Set VPC **Dynamic Routing Mode = GLOBAL** for cross-region propagation.
- **Can‚Äôt SSH via IAP?**
  - Add firewall allow for **35.235.240.0/20** (tcp:22) and ensure `sshd` is running.
- **Overlapping CIDRs**
  - Ensure each participant VPC **CIDR is unique**.
- **NCC visibility**
  - Verify spoke attachments and that the hub shows **healthy** connectivity.

### Task 2 (App / CI)

- **Cloud Run**
  - Check **ingress** and **service account** permissions.
  - Confirm image is up-to-date and built successfully.
- **Cloud Build / CI**
  - Validate pipeline steps: `fmt` ‚Üí `validate` ‚Üí `plan` ‚Üí `apply`.
  - Pin provider versions; review IAM scopes on deploy credentials.

## Escalation

For production-impacting breakage:

1. Revert to last known good commit (or disable the affected module).
2. Open a **High severity** GitHub Issue with logs and repro steps.
3. Email the maintainers with the issue link and impact summary.
