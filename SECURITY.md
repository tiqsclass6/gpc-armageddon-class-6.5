## Security Best Practices

- **Secrets Management**: Never commit `.env` files or API keys to version control. Use **Google Cloud Secrets Manager** or Cloud Run environment variables.  
- **Dependencies**: Keep `requirements.txt` dependencies up to date. Run vulnerability scans regularly (`pip-audit`, `safety`).  
- **Access Control**: Limit IAM roles to **principle of least privilege**.  
- **Networking**: Restrict ingress traffic on Cloud Run to HTTPS only.  
- **CI/CD**: Validate code in Cloud Build with automated tests and security scans before deploying to Cloud Run.  
- **Monitoring**: Enable Google Cloud Logging & Monitoring to detect anomalies.
